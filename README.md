# deezer-list-all-releases
Simple userscript which allows you to view ALL releases of an artist on the artists page, not just the ones Deezer thinks are important (or smth). Tested on Chrome w/ Violentmonkey, should work with any other browser and userscript manager though.#

No UI, just a patch.

Thanks to [DeezMod](https://github.com/bertigert/DeezMod/) also available for Desktop on Windows. See [here](https://github.com/bertigert/DeezMod/blob/main/plugins/display_all_songs.js)
